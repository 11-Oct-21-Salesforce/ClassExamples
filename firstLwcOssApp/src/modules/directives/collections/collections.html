    <!--
        Template directives use template tags with special attributes.

        The for:each template directive allows us to render markup for each item in a collection.
        We data bind the collection to iterate through using curly braces surrounding the name
        of the collection variable in our component's JS module. We pass a string to the for:item
        attribute that will serve as a variable name for the current item in the collection.
    -->
    <template for:each={teams} for:item="team">
        <!-- 
            Every outer tag inside the for:each template directive must have a key attribute
            bound to a unique identifier for each item in the collection.
        -->
        <div key={team.teamName}>{team.teamName}:<b>{team.squadName}</b></div>
    </template>

    <br/>
    <!--
        The iterator directive also allows us to render markup for each item in a collection,
        while also providing special functionality for the first and last items of the collection.
        We pass the name of the iterator as the value following the colon in the iterator attribute.
        
        This iterator variable is what we'll use inside of the template tags. It has four properties
            - first, which holds a Boolean value indicating if the current element is the first element in the collection
            - last, which holds a Boolean value indicating if the current element is the last element in the collection
            - value, which holds the value of the current element in the collection
            - index, which holds the index of the current element in the collection
        
        We data bind the name of the collection variable from our JS module to iterate through to the iterator attribute.
    -->
    <template iterator:team={teams}>
        <!--
            Like with the for:each directive, we need to add a key attribute to each outer tag inside of our directive and data
            bind it to a value that's unique for each element in the collection.
        -->
        <template if:true={team.first} key={team.value.teamName}>
            <div key={team.value.teamName}>{team.value.teamName}: <i>{team.value.squadName}</i></div>
        </template>
        <template if:false={team.first} key={team.value.teamName}>
            <div key={team.value.teamName}>{team.value.teamName}: <span style="font-weight: bold">{team.value.squadName}</span></div>
