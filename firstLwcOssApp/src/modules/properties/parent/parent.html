    <!-- 
        Publicly exposed properties become attributes that we can set when we instantiate the
        component that holds them. The name of the property changes from camelcase to kebab case
        (e.g. childPublicProperty becomes child-public-property). The value that we assign to
        the attribute will be assigned to the property in the child component's JS module.
        Accessor properties appear like regular properties to parent components, so the name of
        the exposed accessor method is used as an attribute on the child component and it changes
        from camelcase to kebab case. Whenever a value is assigned to the event attribute
        corresponding to an accessor property, the setter method is invoked.

        We use public properties to communicate and pass information from parent components
        to children components.
